# Installation

https://www.typescriptlang.org/

```
> npm install -g typescript
```

For better experience, its advised to install "ts-node", on the fly command line ts file runner. https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node

```
> npm install -g ts-node
```

# Compiling & running ts files

```
> tsc index.ts //this command compiles & builds ts files into js files.
> node index.js
```

But with "ts-node"

```
//this command compiles & builds & executes ts files directly, without converting them to js files.
> ts-node index.ts
```
